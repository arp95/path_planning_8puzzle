### Instructions for running the code
To run the code for solving the puzzle, follow the following commands:

```
python bfs.py 'puzzle'
```
where, puzzle is the input state to be solved. For example, running the python file on my local setup was:

```
python bfs.py 123456780
```

Also, puzzle taken as input is in column order. It means that for the above input state '123456780', matrix would look like:
matrix[0th row][0th col] = 1<br>
matrix[1st row][0th col] = 2<br>
matrix[2nd row][0th col] = 3<br>
matrix[0th row][1st col] = 4<br>
matrix[1st row][1st col] = 5<br>
matrix[2nd row][1st col] = 6<br>
matrix[0th row][2nd col] = 7<br>
matrix[1st row][2nd col] = 8<br>
matrix[2nd row][2nd col] = 0<br>

### Software Required
To run the .py files, use Python 3. Standard Python 3 libraries like numpy is used.
